DbTarzan installation
=====================

dbtarzan_XXX.exe : executable for Windows. Just copy it to a directory and run it. dbtarzan needs a [connections.config file](https://aferrandi.github.io/dbtarzan/The-database-connections-configuration-file) in the same directory. 

dbtarzan_XXX_assembly_YYY.jar : (where YYY is linux, win or mac) executable jar for Linux, MacOSX and other OSes. Just copy it to a directory and run it. dbtarzan needs a [connections.config file](https://aferrandi.github.io/dbtarzan/The-database-connections-configuration-file) in the same directory. 

dbtarzan_XXX_all.deb : Debian pacakge for Linux. Download it and install it as a debian package, normally it is enough to double-click on the .deb file from the file manager. It is kind of experimental, because it can't be executed from the system menu, but it starts by typing "dbtarzan" in the shell; and because the debian installer sees it as "non free software", even if it is open source.
