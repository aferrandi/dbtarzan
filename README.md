Database browser.

Explore the tables of a relational database following the relations defined in their foreign keys.

With DbTarzan you can find the information you need from the database in a fraction of the time, without writing queries.  
And if it is the first time you are looking into a database, use DbTarzan to explore it.

Foreign keys are  used as constraints, but they contain information about the relationships among tables. 
DbTarzan uses this information to traverse the tables of a database.

The following video shows an example of database exploration:

Examples
--------

Bank: find fast who is the owner of a contract, its coupons, its portfolio.

Hospital: find fast all the people that got a special kind of sickness.

You can do the same with standard SQL queries or with views, but in this way it is much faster.
This is for example the best tool to explore a database you never saw before.
