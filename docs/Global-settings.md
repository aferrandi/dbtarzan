The following dialog opens:

To change the application language (menus, buttons, log) choose the language in the **Language** combo.

When you are finished press the the **Save** button. If you confirm that you want to save, the changes get saved. 
The changes will be operational after you restart the application.

If instead you changed your mind, press the **Cancel** button, which, after asked you to confirm, will close the dialog loosing the changes.
