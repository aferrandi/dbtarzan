## Examples

**Bank**: with a few mouse clicks, from a single operation, get the source and destination account, the account owners, which other operations was made in the same day between the accounts.

**Hospital**: with a few mouse clicks, from a patient, find the reason of the hospitalization, the insurance data, the clinical history, which other patients are in the hospital for the same reason.

You can do the same with standard SQL queries or with views, but in this way it is much faster.
