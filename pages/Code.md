## Code

DBTarzan is written in [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/), uses [JavaFX 8](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/get-started-tutorial/jfx-overview.htm) via [ScalaFX](http://www.scalafx.org/) for its GUI, uses the actors of [Akka](http://akka.io/), Spray 
(now part of Akka) to read the configurations written in JSON. 

Thanks to these tools, the amount of code is very limited, which makes it easy to understand and to mantain.
